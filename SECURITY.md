# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Job Portal application to ensure data protection, user privacy, and compliance with industry standards.

## Authentication Security

### Password Policy
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain both letters and numbers
- Stored securely (in a real application, passwords would be hashed)

### Session Management
- User sessions are stored in localStorage with secure keys
- Sessions are automatically cleared on logout
- User data is validated before being loaded from storage

### Login Security
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Input validation for email and password formats
- Proper error handling without revealing sensitive information

## Data Validation and Sanitization

### Input Validation
- Email format validation using regex patterns
- Phone number validation for US formats
- URL validation using browser APIs
- Password strength validation

### Output Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized before storage or display
- HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- Removal of potentially dangerous characters

## Data Storage Security

### localStorage Security
- Data is stored with consistent, secure keys
- Sensitive information (like passwords) is never stored
- Data integrity checks are performed on load

### Data Retention
- Application data is retained for 365 days
- Message data is retained for 180 days
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

## Communication Security

### Client-Side Security
- Content Security Policy headers (for documentation)
- XSS protection measures
- Secure data transmission between components

### API Security (for future implementation)
- Rate limiting (60 requests per minute)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Secure password reset mechanisms

## Privacy Measures

### User Data Protection
- Minimal data collection
- No storage of sensitive information like passwords in localStorage
- Clear separation of employer and job seeker data

### Data Anonymization
- User IDs are generated securely
- No personally identifiable information in logs

## Compliance

### Industry Standards
- Follows OWASP best practices
- Implements secure coding guidelines
- Regular security audits (manual review recommended)

## Future Security Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. Implement HTTPS in production
2. Add server-side validation
3. Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2)
4. Add two-factor authentication
5. Implement CSRF protection
6. Add security headers in production
7. Regular security penetration testing

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing
- Validate all input fields
- Test edge cases
- Verify error handling
- Check data persistence

### Automated Testing
- Use security scanning tools
- Implement unit tests for validation functions
- Regular code reviews

## Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues
- Contact development team immediately
- Document vulnerabilities
- Implement patches promptly
- Notify affected users if necessary
